# Mastering_Swift_Cocktails
Mastering Swift Cocktails is an Open Source iOS app, written in Swift and uses SwiftUI for the user interface.  The code is distributed under the MIT license and can be found on my Github page here:  
The app uses The Cocktail DB (https://www.thecocktaildb.com) as the backend data source.  The Cocktail DB is an open, crowd sourced database of drinks on cocktails from around the world.  It uses a free JSON API but also has a free premium APIs as well.  You can see the full list of APIs here:  https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php 
I wrote this app so I can use it as an example on how to develop an app that uses a webservice API as its backend data source.   I plan on writing several posts that explain how the app was written and why I choose to do certain things.  Eventually I plan on submitting it to the app store, as a free app.  
In the meantime, please feel free to grab the source code and play around with the app.  If you have any comments on improving the app, either functionality or code wise, please let me know.
